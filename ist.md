# IST

During my time at IST, I've built various tools as well as solved multiple courses' projects.
Here you can find a list of all those repositories.

## Course Projects

For some projects, I created relases and update them with the grades obtained, along with some feedback about what was wrong.
For projects that include LaTeX reports, the generated PDFs are attached to the releases.

## Project Testing

Tools to ensure projects work as expected. Usually these are unit and/or integration tests that I shared with my peers.

- [diogotcorreia/proj-ist-unit-tests](https://github.com/diogotcorreia/proj-ist-unit-tests): A repository containing unit and integration tests for various courses of various years.
- [diogotcorreia/proj-fp-tester](https://github.com/diogotcorreia/proj-fp-tester): A website where students could paste their code and it would be ran against unit and integration tests.
- [diogotcorreia/proj2-fp-tester](https://github.com/diogotcorreia/proj2-fp-tester): A website where students could paste their code and it would be ran against unit and integration tests.
- [diogotcorreia/kanban-iaed-tests](https://github.com/diogotcorreia/kanban-iaed-tests): Shell scripts to run integration tests for IAED's first project. Later merged into `proj-ist-unit-tests`.
- [diogotcorreia/mooshak-da-feira](https://github.com/diogotcorreia/mooshak-da-feira): An (incomplete) attempt to create a generic testing framework for courses' projects.

## Statistics

Sometimes I collected statistics that I like to show off. They don't include any identifiable information for individual students.
